            p Hello everyone, my name is Erik. Thank you all for beaming me in today to talk about UX.
            p 
            p Before we start, let me give you an idea of how far this transmission is coming from:
            p [map]
            p 14,000 kilometers
            p 
            p And here is where I am, Salt Lake City, Utah. It's 1:00 am but I'm feeling great.
            p [picture] 
            p UX Purpose
            p UX as a new word
            p Stood for "user experience"
            p Almost always "user experience design"
            p The question is asked "does it have good UX?"
            p Translated "is it a good experiential outcome for the user"
            p "Good UX" is the attention to Outcomes
            p The purpose of UX
            p UX is not UI
            p UX is not UI
            p Get rid of the "slash" in UX/UI
            p A confusing similarity in the terms "user experience, user interface"
            p UX is a chaotic process that designs a strategy; it builds towards a solution.
            p Explore the purpose of UX 
            p 
            p 
            p UX Design
            p Might be perceived externally as the same
            p Might be perceived internally as the same
            p What if you don't do design? Can you do UX?
            p Of course - UX is about designing solutions to problems
            p Outcomes
            p 
            p The Outcomes
            p It's the outcome of the resulting experience.
            p Solve problems
            p Delight
            p Empower
            p That is all the user is concerned with
            p Don't fall into the trap of thinking it's about the product
            p Let's look at the user.
            p What the user wants
            p They want an outcome
            p A solution to their problem
            p To feel better than they did moments before
            p An opportunity to be delighted
            p They use what we make
            p They might like it.
            p But it's not what they want
            p They want their outcome
            p They think they want a product, solution
            p But they really want to say "this is great!"
            p So, we're outcome focused
            p Not product focused
            p What we specifically build doesn't matter a whole lot
            p We are interested in the impact
            p The Impact
            p We have the luxury of changing course to meet outcome
            p Pivot, alter, start over Rework, rethink, redesign
            p The experience is the guide on horizon 
            p We really like making things
            p Don't do things just to do them
            p Be on target with the experience goal
            p Biggest obstacle
            p The user's don't know
            p They don't always know their problem
            p Might just be a "I just wish that I hadâ€¦" an outcome
