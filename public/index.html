            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Erik. Thank you all for beaming me in today to talk about UX.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Before we start, let me give you an idea of how far this transmission is coming from:</p>
            <p>[map]</p>
            <p>14,000 kilometers</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>And here is where I am, Salt Lake City, Utah. It's 1:00 am but I'm feeling great.</p>
            <p>[picture] </p>
            <p>UX Purpose</p>
            <p>UX as a new word</p>
            <p>Stood for "user experience"</p>
            <p>Almost always "user experience design"</p>
            <p>The question is asked "does it have good UX?"</p>
            <p>Translated "is it a good experiential outcome for the user"</p>
            <p>"Good UX" is the attention to Outcomes</p>
            <p>The purpose of UX</p>
            <p>UX is not UI</p>
            <p>UX is not UI</p>
            <p>Get rid of the "slash" in UX/UI</p>
            <p>A confusing similarity in the terms "user experience, user interface"</p>
            <p>UX is a chaotic process that designs a strategy; it builds towards a solution.</p>
            <p>Explore the purpose of UX </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>UX Design</p>
            <p>Might be perceived externally as the same</p>
            <p>Might be perceived internally as the same</p>
            <p>What if you don't do design? Can you do UX?</p>
            <p>Of course - UX is about designing solutions to problems</p>
            <p>Outcomes</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The Outcomes</p>
            <p>It's the outcome of the resulting experience.</p>
            <p>Solve problems</p>
            <p>Delight</p>
            <p>Empower</p>
            <p>That is all the user is concerned with</p>
            <p>Don't fall into the trap of thinking it's about the product</p>
            <p>Let's look at the user.</p>
            <p>What the user wants</p>
            <p>They want an outcome</p>
            <p>A solution to their problem</p>
            <p>To feel better than they did moments before</p>
            <p>An opportunity to be delighted</p>
            <p>They use what we make</p>
            <p>They might like it.</p>
            <p>But it's not what they want</p>
            <p>They want their outcome</p>
            <p>They think they want a product, solution</p>
            <p>But they really want to say "this is great!"</p>
            <p>So, we're outcome focused</p>
            <p>Not product focused</p>
            <p>What we specifically build doesn't matter a whole lot</p>
            <p>We are interested in the impact</p>
            <p>The Impact</p>
            <p>We have the luxury of changing course to meet outcome</p>
            <p>Pivot, alter, start over Rework, rethink, redesign</p>
            <p>The experience is the guide on horizon </p>
            <p>We really like making things</p>
            <p>Don't do things just to do them</p>
            <p>Be on target with the experience goal</p>
            <p>Biggest obstacle</p>
            <p>The user's don't know</p>
            <p>They don't always know their problem</p>
            <p>Might just be a "I just wish that I hadâ€¦" an outcome</p>
